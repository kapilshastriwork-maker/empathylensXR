# 👁 EmpathyLens XR

> **Cambridge RealityX 2026 — XR in Healthcare Track**

**Step Into Their World** — An immersive WebXR experience that simulates neurological conditions from the patient's perspective, helping healthcare workers and caregivers build deeper empathy through AI-powered patient interactions.

🌐 **Live Demo:** https://kapilshastriwork-maker.github.io/empathylensXR/

## 🎯 The Problem

Healthcare workers train without ever truly experiencing what their patients feel. Neurological conditions like dementia, Parkinson's, and anxiety disorder are deeply misunderstood — not from lack of care, but from lack of perspective.

**EmpathyLens XR bridges this gap.**

| Condition | People Affected |
|-----------|----------------|
| 🧠 Dementia | 55M+ worldwide |
| 🫀 Parkinson's Disease | 10M+ new cases/year |
| 😰 Anxiety Disorder | 284M+ globally |

## 🥽 What It Does

EmpathyLens XR puts you inside a 3D hospital room and simulates what it feels like to live with a neurological condition — complete with visual effects, audio cues, and a real AI-powered patient to talk to.

### Three Immersive Simulations

**🧠 Dementia — Margaret, Age 78**
- Memory flash overlays ("Where am I?", "What day is it?")
- Greyscale visual desaturation
- Slow disorientation drift effect
- Purple vignette border
- AI patient who repeats herself, trails off, and asks for her daughter

**🫀 Parkinson's Disease — Robert, Age 71**
- Continuous screen tremor simulation
- Tremor burst intensification every 5 seconds
- Orange vignette border
- AI patient with slow, drawn-out speech patterns

**😰 Anxiety Disorder — Sarah, Age 34**
- Live BPM counter rising from 72 → 118 BPM
- Pulsing red vignette synced to heartbeat
- Heartbeat audio via Web Audio API
- Breathing scale animation
- AI patient who speaks in rushed, worried sentences
